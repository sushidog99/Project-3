					<p>George Boole Quotes</p>

					<p span style="background-color: #595959">“I am fully assured, that no general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognize, not only the special numerical bases of the science, <em> but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning, </em> and which, whatever they may be as to their essence, are at least mathematical as to their form.”</p>

					<p span style="background-color: #595959">“No matter how correct a mathematical theorem may appear to be, one ought never to be satisfied that there was not something imperfect about it until it also <em>gives the impression of being beautiful.</em>”</p>

					<p span style="background-color: #595959">“That <em>language is an instrument of human reason</em>, and not merely a medium for the expression of thought, is a truth generally admitted.”</p>
