					<h3 align="center">George Boole Computing Personality</h3>

					<p span style="background-color: #595959"> There have been many amazing innovators and predecessors of the history of computing, each one influential in the technologies today. George Boole’s work, however, could be regarded as one of the most integral in shaping our digital age, and uniquely brilliant in its insight of a mathematical system of logic used in every electronic device today. Born November 2nd, 1815 in Lincolnshire, England, Boole’s gift for knowledge was apparent at a very young age as he translated “Ode of Horace” from Latin into English at 12, yet his critics doubted a child was capable of such an achievement, and they showed the translation had errors. In response to this, Boole refined his understanding of Latin and Greek over the next 2 years. As many philosophers have suggested, Boole probably was influenced by Aristotle’s original works after learning Greek, this is a point best supported by the similarity between Boole’s “Laws of Thought” and Aristotle’s “Prior Analytics”. In the former paper, Boole laid out the foundations of Boolean Algebra, an algebraic representation of logical true and false involving logic gates such as AND, EITHER, and, NOT. Interestingly enough, Aristotle’s Laws of Logic outlined in the latter paper also involve manipulations of truth and falsehood in similar ways, but without a formal mathematical system.</p>
